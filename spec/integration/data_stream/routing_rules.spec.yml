            In addition to the criteria for index names, cannot contain - and must be no longer than 100 characters.
            Example values are nginx.access and nginx.error.

            Supports field references with a mustache-like syntax (denoted as {{double}} or {{{triple}}} curly braces).
            When resolving field references, the processor replaces invalid characters with _.
            Uses the <dataset> part of the index name as a fallback if all field references resolve to a null, missing, or non-string value
