              Specifying that a variable is secret means that Kibana will store the value
              separate from the package policy in a more secure index. 
              This is useful for passwords and other sensitive information.
              One caveat is that secrets are write-only, once a user writes a secret var
              they cannot read it again, only overwrite it.
