      value:
        description: The value to associate with a constant_keyword field.
        type: string

      metric_type:
        description: >
          The metric type of a numeric field. This is attached to the
          field as metadata (via `meta`). A gauge is a single-value measurement
          that can go up or down over time, such as a temperature. A counter is
          a single-value cumulative counter that only goes up, such as the
          number of requests processed by a web server. By default, no metric
          type is associated with a field.
        type: string
        enum:
        - counter
        - gauge

      unit:
        description: >
          Unit type to associate with a numeric field. This is attached to the
          field as metadata (via `meta`). By default, a field does not have a
          unit. The convention for percents is to use value 1 to mean 100%.
        type: string
        enum:
        - byte
        - percent
        - d
        - h
        - m
        - s
        - ms
        - micros
        - nanos

      dimension:
        description: Declare a field as dimension of time series
        type: boolean
        default: false

      pattern:
        description: >
          Regular expression pattern matching the allowed values for the field.
          This is used for development-time data validation.
        type: string
        examples:
          - '^[a-zA-Z]$'

      external:
        description: External source reference
        type: string
        enum:
          - ecs

      fields:
        description: Sub-fields, when type is group
        $ref: "#"     # JSON-schema syntax for pointing to the root of the schema

      doc_values:
        description: >
          Controls whether doc values are enabled for a field. All fields which
          support doc values have them enabled by default. If you are sure that
          you don’t need to sort or aggregate on a field, or access the field
          value from a script, you can disable doc values in order to save disk
          space. You cannot disable doc values for wildcard fields.
        type: boolean

      index:
        description: >
          The index option controls whether field values are indexed. Fields
          that are not indexed are typically not queryable.
        type: boolean
        default: true

      copy_to:
        description: >
          The copy_to parameter allows you to copy the values of multiple fields
          into a group field, which can then be queried as a single field.
        type: string

      enabled:
        description: >
          The enabled setting, which can be applied only to the top-level
          mapping definition and to object fields, causes Elasticsearch to skip
          parsing of the contents of the field entirely. The JSON can still be
          retrieved from the _source field, but it is not searchable or stored
          in any other way.
        type: boolean

      dynamic:
        description: >
          The dynamic parameter controls whether new fields are added
          dynamically. It accepts the following values:

          true -  New fields are added to the mapping (default).

          runtime - New fields are added to the mapping as runtime fields. These
          fields are not indexed, and are loaded from _source at query time.

          false - New fields are ignored. These fields will not be indexed or
          searchable, but will still appear in the _source field of returned
          hits. These fields will not be added to the mapping, and new fields
          must be added explicitly.

          strict -  If new fields are detected, an exception is thrown and the
          document is rejected. New fields must be explicitly added to the
          mapping.
        default: true
        enum:
          - true
          - false
          - strict
          - runtime  # Not supported at this time by Fleet.

      scaling_factor:
        description: >
          The scaling factor to use when encoding values. Values will be
          multiplied by this factor at index time and rounded to the closest
          long value. For instance, a scaled_float with a scaling_factor of 10
          would internally store 2.34 as 23 and all search-time operations
          (queries, aggregations, sorting) will behave as if the document had a
          value of 2.3. High values of scaling_factor improve accuracy but also
          increase space requirements. Only valid for 'type: scaled_float'.
        type: integer
        default: 1000

      analyzer:
        description: >
          Name of the analyzer to use for indexing. Unless search_analyzer is
          specified this analyzer is used for both indexing and searching.
          Only valid for 'type: text'.
        type: string

      search_analyzer:
        description: >
          Name of the analyzer to use for searching. Only valid for 'type: text'.
        type: string

      multi_fields:
        description: >
          It is often useful to index the same field in different ways for
          different purposes. This is the purpose of multi-fields. For instance,
          a string field could be mapped as a text field for full-text search,
          and as a keyword field for sorting or aggregations.

          Only honored for 'type: text/keyword/wildcard'.
        $ref: "#" # JSON-schema syntax for pointing to the root of the schema

      # TODO: Fleet only honors this for 'type: wildcard'. That seems wrong.
      null_value:
        description: >
          The null_value parameter allows you to replace explicit null values
          with the specified value so that it can be indexed and searched.

          A null value cannot be indexed or searched. When a field is set to
          null, (or an empty array or an array of null values) it is treated as
          though that field has no values.

          The null_value needs to be the same data type as the field. For
          instance, a long field cannot have a string null_value.

          The null_value only influences how data is indexed, it doesn’t modify
          the _source document.
        examples:
          - "NULL"

      ignore_above:
        description: >
          Strings longer than the ignore_above setting will not be indexed or
          stored. For arrays of strings, ignore_above will be applied for each
          array element separately and string elements longer than ignore_above
          will not be indexed or stored. Only honored for
          'type: keyword/wildcard'. Defaults to 1024.
        type: integer
        default: 1024

      object_type:
        description: >
          Required for `type: array` to specify the data type in the array.
        type: string

      path:
        description: >
          For alias type fields this is the path to the target field. Note that
          this must be the full path, including any parent objects
          (e.g. object1.object2.field).
        type: string

      normalizer:
        description: >
          Specifies the name of a normalizer to apply to keyword fields. A
          simple normalizer called lowercase ships with elasticsearch and can be
          used. Custom normalizers can be defined as part of analysis index
          settings.
        type: string
        
    required:
    - name
