        An Elasticsearch transform folder.
        Upon installation of a package that contains a transform asset, the create behavior is as follows:
        1. If a destination index template is included:
          1. Create the destination index template.
             The name of the created index template will be derived from the name of the package and the name of the containing folder,
             For example: `example_package.example_name`.
          2. Add the appropriate _meta fields to mark the matching indices as managed by Fleet.
          3. If a fields directory is included:
            1. Use the defined fields as the destination index template mappings.
          4. if the destination index doesn't already exist:
            1. Initialize the index.
        2. Create the transform in the default namespace using kibana_system privileges.
           The name of the created transform will be derived from the name of the package and the name of the containing folder,
           For example: `example_package.example_name-default-0.0.1`.
           Namespace and version are added by fleet.
        3. If the transform is configured to be started upon installation (no configuration defaults to true):
          1. Start the transform.

        Upon upgrading a package that contains a transform asset, the upgrade behavior is as follows:
        1. If a destination index template is included:
          1. Delete the destination index template.
          2. Matching indices are not deleted.
        2. If the transform is started:
          1. Stop the transform.
        3. Delete the transform.
        4. From here, follow the creation behavior.
