        An Elasticsearch transform folder.
        Upon installation of a package that contains a transform asset, the create behavior is as follows:
        1. If a destination index template is included:
          1. Create the destination index template.
             The name of the created index template will be derived from the data type, the name of the package and the name of the containing folder,
             For example: `logs-example_package.example_name`.
          2. Add the appropriate _meta fields to mark the matching indices as managed by Fleet.
          3. If a fields directory is included:
            1. Use the defined fields as the destination index template mappings.
          4. if the destination index doesn't already exist:
            1. Initialize the index.
        2. Create the transform in the default namespace using kibana_system privileges.
           The name of the created transform will be derived from the data type, the name of the package and the name of the containing folder,
           For example: `logs-example_package.example_name-default-0.0.1`.
           Namespace and version are added by fleet.
        3. If the transform is configured to be started upon installation (no configuration defaults to true):
          1. Start the transform.

        Upon upgrading a package that contains a transform asset, the upgrade behavior is as follows:
        1. If a destination index template is included:
          1. Delete the destination index template.
          2. Matching indices are not deleted.
        2. If the transform is started:
          1. Stop the transform.
        3. Delete the transform.
        4. From here, follow the creation behavior.

        The recommended naming convention for the source and destination indices is the data stream naming scheme, or patterns matching the data stream naming scheme.
        Data streams are named in the following way: `{type}-{dataset}-{namespace}`,
        For example: `logs-example_package.example_name-default`.
