      - name: log_group_name
        type: text
        title: "Log Group Name"
        description: |-
          Name of the log group to collect logs from. `region_name` is required when `log_group_name` is given.
      - name: log_group_name_prefix
        type: text
        title: "Log Group Name Prefix"
        description: |-
          The prefix for a group of log group names. `region_name` is required when `log_group_name_prefix` is given. `log_group_name` and `log_group_name_prefix` cannot be given at the same time.
      - name: include_linked_accounts_with_prefix
        type: bool
        title: "Include Linked Accounts with prefix"
        description: |-
          Include log groups from linked accounts when using `log_group_name_prefix` to derive the monitoring log groups.
      - name: region_name
        type: text
        title: "Region Name"
        description: |-
          Region that the specified log group or log group prefix belongs to.
      - name: number_of_workers
        type: integer
        title: "Number of Workers"
        description: |-
          The number of workers assigned to read from log groups. Each worker will read log events from one of the log groups matching `log_group_name_prefix`. For example, if `log_group_name_prefix` matches five log groups, then `number_of_workers` should be set to `5`. The default value is `1`.
        default: 1
      - name: log_streams
        type: text
        title: "Log Streams"
        description: |-
          A list of strings of log streams names that Filebeat collect log events from.
        multi: true
      - name: log_stream_prefix
        type: text
        title: "Log Stream Prefix"
        description: |-
          A string to filter the results to include only log events from log streams that have names starting with this prefix.
      - name: start_position
        type: text
        title: "Start Position"
        description: |-
          Specify whether the input should start reading logs from the `beginning` (oldest log entry), `end` (newest log entry), or `lastSync` (last successful read timestamp if input ran before).
        show_user: true
        default: beginning
      - name: scan_frequency
        type: text
        title: "Scan Frequency"
        description: |-
          This config parameter sets how often Filebeat checks for new log events from the specified log group.
        default: 1m
      - name: api_timeput
        type: text
        title: "API Timeout"
        description: |-
          The maximum duration of AWS API can take. If it exceeds the timeout, AWS API will be interrupted.
        default: 120s
      - name: api_sleep
        type: text
        title: "API Sleep"
        description: |-
          This is used to sleep between AWS FilterLogEvents API calls inside the same collection period. `FilterLogEvents` API has a quota of 5 transactions per second (TPS)/account/Region. This value should only be adjusted when there are multiple Filebeats or multiple Filebeat inputs collecting logs from the same region and AWS account.
        default: 200ms
      - name: latency
        type: text
        title: "Latency"
        description: |-
          The amount of time required for the logs to be available to CloudWatch Logs. Sample values, `1m` or `5m` — see Golang [time.ParseDuration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) for more details. Latency translates the query's time range to consider the CloudWatch Logs latency. Example: `5m` means that the integration will query CloudWatch to search for logs available 5 minutes ago.
      - name: tags
        type: text
        title: "Tags"
        multi: true
        required: true

          - forwarded
      - name: processors
        type: yaml
        title: "Processors"
        description: |-
          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
      - name: preserve_original_event
        type: bool
        title: "Preserve original event"
        description: |-
          Preserves a raw copy of the original event, added to the field `event.original`

      - name: data_stream.dataset
        type: text
        title: "Dataset name"
        description: |-
          Set the name for your dataset. Changing the dataset will send the data to a different index. You can't use `-` in the name of a dataset and only valid characters for [Elasticsearch index names](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-index_.html).
        required: true

        title: "Custom configurations"
        description: |-
          Additional settings to be added to the configuration. Be careful using this as it might break the input as those settings are not validated and can override the settings specified above. See [`aws-cloudwatch` input settings docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-aws-cloudwatch.html) for details.
