In Vega, you have the full control of what data is loaded, even from multiple sources, how that data is transformed, and what visual elements are used to show it.  Use help icon to view Vega examples, tutorials, and other docs.  Use the wrench icon to reformat this text, or to remove comments.\n\nThis example graph shows the document count in all indexes in the current time range.
